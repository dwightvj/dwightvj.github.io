I learned something really cool from my peer feedback! 
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
sns.set()
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = read_csv(url)
```

I use pandas to import data (in this case a comma separated csv that is stored on GitHub). The seaborn library is a data visualization library that produces attractive statistical graphs. For reference it is similar to the more commonly used matplotlib library, which is typically used for basic plotting. Additionaly I use 'sns.set()' for figure aesthetics in order to create a light blue background grid. 

```python
penguins['Species'] = penguins['Species'].str.replace('(', '\n(', regex = True)
```
After reading in the file I am interested in, I add a new line in the 'Species' column. The 'Species' column has entries in the form: 'Penguin Species' (Latin Name).' For the sake of creating a more concise legend, as seen below, I incorporate a newline character between 'Penguin Species' and '(Latin Name).' This allows me to create a multi-line legend in my figure below. The way I acheive this is by using str.replace(), to incorporate a new line character before the open parenthesis in '(Latin Name).'

```python
# create stacked bar chart
ax = sns.histplot(penguins, x='studyName', hue = 'Species',
             multiple='stack', shrink=0.8)

ax.set_xlabel('Study Name')
ax.set_title('Penguin Species Count Across Studies')

# align legend to be outside of main figure
legend = ax.get_legend()
legend.set_bbox_to_anchor((1, 1))
```

 I wanted to create a visualization that looks at how many species were counted in each study in this dataframey. In this study there are 3 distinct studies ('PAL0708', 'PAL0809', and 'PAL0910'). Therefore, I generate 3 distinct stacked bars. Using sns.histplot() I am able to specify what each bar represent (x = 'studyName'). I specify what each 'stack' in a bar represents by setting hue = 'Species'. This ensures that the color-code my stacked bar chart follows is based on the three distinct Species that exist across the entire dataframe. Lastly, in order to create a legend I use the get_legend() method. For the sake of aesthetics I 'anchor' or place my legend to the outside of my main figure. I do so to prevent my legend from covering the main figure.
